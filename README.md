# Etch-a-Sketch

Project consist of designing a blank canvas made of,
originally, 16 rows x 16 columns of squares (although 
user can choose sizes between 1 x 1 and 99 x 99 after 
web page loads). There are some painting colors to choose
from (red, yellow, green, blue, white, and black) as well
as 10 options for color opacity.
